# 🏗 Autonomous AI Game Studio Guide

Welcome to your Godot AI Game Studio. You are no longer just using a tool; you are managing a specialized team of AI agents.

## 👥 The Studio Team
- **Architect**: Plans your Scene Tree and chooses the best node types for your vision.
- **Logic Engineer**: Writes industry-standard GDScript with type hints and optimized loops.
- **Visual Designer**: Sets up shaders, materials, and lighting. Provides AI art prompts for assets.
- **QA Lead**: Ensures your game has a functional loop, HUD, and handles project polish/bug-fixing.

## 🚀 Autonomous Mode
Toggle the **Autonomous Mode** button to let the studio build a full project feature.
1. **Planning Phase**: The AI will first generate a **Roadmap** appearing as a progress panel in your dock.
2. **Execution Phase**: The studio will cycle through each step, building scenes and writing code.

### 🛑 Step-by-Step Mode (Safety First)
Enable the **Step-By-Step** checkbox to review and approve every single move the AI makes. This is recommended for complex architectural changes!

## 🗨️ Live In-Game Link
Press **TAB** while your game is running to open the **Neural Link**. Talk to your Architect live to:
- "Double the enemy spawn rate."
- "Change the player's color to neon green."
- "Add a shield power-up near the player."

## 🤖 Neural Self-Healing
If the AI introduces a syntax error, the **QA Lead** will automatically detect it and write a hotfix. No debugging required!
